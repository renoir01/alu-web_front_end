Sass (Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets)
Sass is a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). SassScript is the scripting language itself. It provides powerful features to enhance CSS, such as variables, nested rules, mixins, and functions, making stylesheets more maintainable and easier to read.

Features
Variables: Store values in variables and reuse them throughout your stylesheets.
Nesting: Nest your CSS selectors in a way that follows the same visual hierarchy of your HTML.
Partials and Import: Split your CSS into smaller, manageable files and import them into a main stylesheet.
Mixins: Create reusable chunks of styles that can be included in other selectors.
Inheritance: Share a set of CSS properties from one selector to another using @extend.
Functions: Create reusable functions to perform calculations and manipulate values.
